	Coming into GPS-1.1 there was nothing that stuck out as a pain point in my understanding of Git and GitHub. I knew I didn't have everything perfectly but I felt fairly confident about being able to navigate through the challenge. Katy helped clarify correct tense for a commit message, which I have found very useful. Unfotunately, I don't remember what questions I asked during the session. I am still confused about what proper "navigation" procedures are based on a given branch.  I guess to clarify I don't understand fully all the different aspects of the vocabulary.  Why are we using the word "push" and is a direction always implied?  What if I enter "git push  [localmasterbranch] [featurebranch]"?  What is upstream? Can I push any branch to any other branch or is there a 'chain of custody'? 

	I really enjoyed pairing in a GPS! It's comforting to feel like I am on a team, and everyone is moer concerned with doing a good job than judging other team members.
